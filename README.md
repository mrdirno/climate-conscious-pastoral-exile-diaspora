## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter from the perspective of Dr. Anya Sharma returning to her controlled urban arcology, contrasting its sterile 'safety' with the messy vitality of Elara's farm.
- Create a 'field guide' entry for a plant in Elara's seed bank, detailing its history, uses, and the story of how it came to be in her cellar.
- Write a scene where Elara's children, hiding in the root cellar, overhear the conversation at the gate and discuss their fears and loyalties.
- Draft a 'message' sent via the exile network (foot and memory) calling for a gathering, capturing the unique voice and hidden codes of the diaspora.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a 'Resilience Map' for the exile diaspora network, showing nodes (farms), connections (trade routes, messengers), and resources (seed banks, skills).
- Prototype a 'Counter-Metrics' system the exiles could use to quantify their sustainability in a way that values embodied knowledge and community health over pure yield.
