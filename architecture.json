  "cover_prompt": "A solitary elder, their hands cradling a sprouting seed while ancient, weathered maps are reclaimed by thorny vines at their feet, embodying the tension between lived wisdom and cold bureaucracy. This intimate scene is set at the edge of a resilient, pastoral community of exiles, where makeshift greenhouses built from salvaged tech sit beside wild meadows, under a vast, moody sky that speaks of both loss and hope. In the atmospheric style of Caspar David Friedrich's sublime landscapes and the textured, ecological detail of Thomas Cole's pastoral scenes, rendered with the emotional depth and brushwork of a John Atkinson Grimshaw twilight. Book cover framing, a centered and intimate composition viewed from a low, reverent angle, emphasizing the hands and seed as a focal point against the sweeping, contested landscape. Dramatic, volumetric lighting with a chiaroscuro effect, where warm, golden-hour light from the community hearths fights against the cool, analytical blue glow of distant reclamation drones, palette of earthy umbers, resilient greens, and deep twilight violets. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
